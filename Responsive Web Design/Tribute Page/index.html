                Farewell, my adored Land, region of the sun caressed,<br>
                Pearl of the Orient Sea, our Eden lost,<br>
                With gladness I give you my life, sad and repressed;<br>
                And were it more brilliant, more fresh and at its best,<br>
                I would still give it to you for your welfare at most.<br><br>
                
                On the fields of battle, in the fury of fight,<br>
                Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy,<br>
                The place does not matter: cypress, laurel, lily white;<br>
                Scaffold, open field, conflict or martyrdom's site,<br>
                It is the same if asked by the home and country.<br><br>
                
                I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to show<br>
                And at last announce the day, after a gloomy night;<br>
                If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow,<br>
                Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so,<br>
                And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light<br><br>
                
                My dreams, when scarcely a lad adolescent,<br>
                My dreams when already a youth, full of vigor to attain,<br>
                Were to see you, Gem of the Sea of the Orient,<br>
                Your dark eyes dry, smooth brow held to a high plane,<br>
                Without frown, without wrinkles and of shame without stain.<br><br>
                
                My life's fancy, my ardent, passionate desire,<br>
                Hail! Cries out the soul to you, that will soon part from thee;<br>
                Hail! How sweet 'tis to fall that fullness you may acquire;<br>
                To die to give you life, 'neath your skies to expire,<br>
                And in thy mystic land to sleep through eternity!<br><br>
                
                If over my tomb some day, you would see blow,<br>
                A simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses,<br>
                Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so,<br>
                And under the cold tomb, I may feel on my brow,<br>
                Warmth of your breath, a whiff of thy tenderness.<br><br>
                
                Let the moon with soft, gentle light me descry,<br>
                Let the dawn send forth its fleeting, brilliant light,<br>
                In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh,<br>
                And should a bird descend on my cross and alight,<br>
                Let the bird intone a song of peace o'er my site.<br><br>
                
                Let the burning sun the raindrops vaporize<br>
                And with my clamor behind return pure to the sky;<br>
                Let a friend shed tears over my early demise;<br>
                And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high,<br>
                Pray too, oh, my Motherland, that in God may rest I.<br><br>
                
                Pray thee for all the hapless who have died,<br>
                For all those who unequalled torments have undergone;<br>
                For our poor mothers who in bitterness have cried;<br>
                For orphans, widows and captives to tortures were shied,<br>
                And pray too that you may see your own redemption.<br><br>
                
                And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ry<br>
                And only the dead to vigil there are left alone,<br>
                Don't disturb their repose, disturb not the mystery:<br>
                If thou hear the sounds of cithern or psaltery,<br>
                It is I, dear Country, who, a song t'you intone.<br><br>
                
                And when my grave by all is no more remembered,<br>
                With neither cross nor stone to mark its place,<br>
                Let it be plowed by man, with spade let it be scattered<br>
                And my ashes ere to nothingness are restored,<br>
                Let them turn to dust to cover thy earthly space.<br><br>
                
                Then it doesn't matter that you should forget me:<br>
                Your atmosphere, your skies, your vales I'll sweep;<br>
                Vibrant and clear note to your ears I shall be:<br>
                Aroma, light, hues, murmur, song, moanings deep,<br>
                Constantly repeating the essence of the faith I keep.<br><br>
                
                My idolized Country, for whom I most gravely pine,<br>
                Dear Philippines, to my last goodbye, oh, harken<br>
                There I leave all: my parents, loves of mine,<br>
                I'll go where there are no slaves, tyrants or hangmen<br>
                Where faith does not kill and where God alone does reign.<br><br>
                
                Farewell, parents, brothers, beloved by me,<br>
                Friends of my childhood, in the home distressed;<br>
                Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day;<br>
                Farewell, sweet stranger, my friend, who brightened my way;<br> 
                Farewell to all I love; to die is to rest.<br><br>
